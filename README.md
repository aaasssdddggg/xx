## Good Enough Scheduler

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About:
Scheduler is used to run a task everyday and it is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Scheduler is going to send an email that contains a list of the products that are about to expire. Notifying the user everyday, three days before the expiration date.


## üéØ Functionality:
1- The is_used flag should be false for the notified item.

2- The user should get notified for three days before the expiration date at 6pm time zone (America/New_York). 

3- If the items are expired, they should be removed from the item table and added to the shopping list table.

4- The Scheduler will ping itself to keep it awake on Heroku. [more details](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours)
